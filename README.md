# gameengine-utilities
A homemade utilities library for various game engine utilities such as Camera, Vectors, Matrices, Quaternions and such.

DISCLAIMER:
This is my first time doing a math/camera library and also the very first time I am exposed to C++ so be vary that there might be some or many suboptimal solutions.
